**[gophersnippets](https://gophersnippets.com)** is a collection of code snippets with tests and testable examples for the Go programming language. 

Each snippet:
 - is small and shows how to achieve something specific with Go 
 - contains at least one test or testable example
 - runs on [Go playground](https://play.golang.org/) since it now supports tests and testable examples
